Development

You'll need the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) (aka `gcloud`) with the `cloud-datastore-emulator` [component](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/components#additional_components).

Then, clone this repo, install the dependencies with `npm install`, and you should be all set!

To run the unit tests:

```sh
npm test
```


To run the app locally:

```sh
npm start
```

...then open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

Where did the name come from? [Acoustic baffles](https://soundcontroltech.com/baffles-banners-clouds/what-is-an-acoustic-baffle/) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_baffle)) redirect sound, Baffle redirects readers.

(...OK, yes, it's a stretch. 😄)
